# IS 117 - Introduction to Website Development

### Course Description
<p>
  This course discusses the concepts and skills required to plan, design and build websites. It will be taught in a lab to ensure hands-on experience with each of these tasks. The course begins with an overview of web technologies. Students learn to plan websites, which includes determining the business and end-user requirements for the site. Design includes learning to develop "mockups" of how the site will look and how people will use it. The major tools for building websites will be industry standard HTML and XHTML to describe webpage content, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for flexibly formatting the content.
